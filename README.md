# p-adic-visualization
Utility for generating visualizations of p-adic integer cosets. Will eventually add functionality for viewing the transformations of Z_p under functions like the exponential exp.

Best visualization so far is the 7^7Z_7 cosets SWIRL. You may have to download to see it since it is very large.

Also check out "7-adic 7^9Z_7 cosets.png" and "dragon.png"!
